## Project Structure

- `src/` – Source code for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison  
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets used in the project  
- `docs/` – Weekly notes and project documentation  
- `final_model_comparison.csv` – Consolidated comparison of all trained models  

## Week 3 Summary

In Week 3, multiple machine learning classification models were implemented and evaluated
across three cybersecurity-related datasets. Models were compared using accuracy and F1-score
metrics, and visual comparisons were generated to identify the most effective approaches for
AI-powered threat detection.
